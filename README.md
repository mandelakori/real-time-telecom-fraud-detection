# Static Fraud Detection

## Overview

**Static Fraud Detection** is a machine learning project designed to classify SMS/text messages as either **fraudulent** (scam/phishing) or **normal** (legitimate).  
The system uses **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques and **supervised machine learning** models to detect fraudulent message patterns such as fake banking requests, lottery scams, and phishing attempts.

## Goals

- Develop a clean and reproducible pipeline for fraud detection.
- Compare baseline and advanced ML models on fraud classification tasks.
- Deploy a simple API that classifies incoming messages.

# Usage Instructions
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
python src/inference.py
```
