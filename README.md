# Static Fraud Detection

## Overview

**Static Fraud Detection** is a machine learning project designed to classify SMS/text messages as either **fraudulent** (scam/phishing) or **normal** (legitimate).  
The system uses **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques and **supervised machine learning** models to detect fraudulent message patterns such as fake banking requests, lottery scams, and phishing attempts.

## Goals

- Develop a clean and reproducible pipeline for fraud detection.
- Compare baseline and advanced ML models on fraud classification tasks.
- Deploy a simple API that classifies incoming messages.


## Demo
All data is **simulated**. No real telecom data is used. This project is for demonstration purposes only and is **not intended for deployment** outside the scope of the owner.
